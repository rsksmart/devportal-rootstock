## TheGraph

Getting historical data on smart contracts can be challenging when building dApps. [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) provides an easy way to query smart contracts data through APIs known as [subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/developer-faqs/#1-what-is-a-subgraph). Its infrastructure relies on a decentralized network of indexers, enabling dApps to achieve true decentralization. See [Getting started with TheGraph](./thegraph.md).

## Envio

[Envio](https://envio.dev/) is a feature-rich indexing solution that provides developers with a seamless and efficient way to index and aggregate real-time or historical blockchain data for Rootstock, and **other EVM chains**. The indexed data is easily accessible through custom [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) queries, giving developers the flexibility and power to retrieve specific information.

Envio offers native support for Rootstock and has been designed to support high-throughput blockchain applications that rely on real-time data for their business requirements.

Designed to optimize the developer experience, Envio offers automatic code generation, flexible language support, quickstart templates, and a reliable, cost-effective hosted service.

Indexers on Envio can be written in [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), or [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/).

## Covalent

Covalent provides the industry-leading Unified API bringing visibility to billions of Web3 data points. Developers use Covalent to build exciting multi-chain applications like crypto wallets, NFT galleries, and investor dashboard tools utilizing data from 100+ blockchains including Rootstock.

The Covalent API maintains a full archival copy of every supported blockchain, meaning every balance, transaction, log event, and NFT asset data is available from the genesis block. This data is available via:

1. [Unified API](#unified-api) - Incorporate blockchain data into your app with a familiar REST API
2. [Increment](#increment) - Create and embed custom charts with no-code analytics

### Why use Covalent?

Use Covalent if you need:
* Structured and enhanced on-chain data well beyond what you get from RPC providers
* Broad and deep multi-chain data at scale
* Enterprise-grade performance
