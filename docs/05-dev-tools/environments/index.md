## Hardhat
[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/docs) is an Ethereum development environment for developers. It's primarily used in the development of smart contracts for the Rootstock and EVM-compatible chains.

## Remix

[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is an online web tool. It is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) used to write, compile, deploy and debug Solidity code. Can be connected with Metamask and used to deploy smart contracts to both the Rootstock Testnet and Mainnet.

## Foundry

[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh) is a smart contract development toolchain, and user-friendly development environment for writing and testing smart contracts in Solidity. It manages dependencies, compiles, run tests, deploy contracts and allows for interaction with EVM-compatible chains using a command-line tool called [Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/).
