## RPC 

### RPC API

The [RPC API](http://rpc.rootstock.io/) provides a seamless and intuitive web interface for developers to interact with [Rootstock nodes](/node-operators/setup/) via [JSON-RPC](/node-operators/json-rpc/methods/) methods. It aims to address the challenges faced by developers when trying to access critical information like logs, transactions, and balances through RPC, which can significantly impact the timely development of dApps on the Rootstock blockchain.

### GetBlock

GetBlock provides instant connection to blockchain nodes including Rootstock, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), among others.

### NOWNodes

NOWNodes is a blockchain-as-a-service enterprise solution that lets users get access to full Nodes and blockbook Explorers via an API.

### dRPC

dRPC provides access to a distributed network of node providers.
