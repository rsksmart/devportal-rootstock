## Umbrella Network

Umbrella Network provides access to reliable and secure data verified by Umbrella's decentralized network. Utilize Umbrella's Data Layer to build customizable and composable data streams on demand on Rootstock.

## RedStone Finance

[RedStone](https://redstone.finance/) provides data feeds to blockchains such as Rootstock and layer 2 scaling solutions across the entire blockchain ecosystem that are both EVM and non-EVM compatible. RedStone allows data to be provided on-demand rather than on a fixed schedule, reducing the costs of putting data 'on-chain'. This is achieved by storing data off of the blockchain as cryptography signed packages and allowing smart contracts of dApps to fetch data when necessary.
