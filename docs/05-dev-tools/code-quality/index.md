Here you can find tools to test and verify your smart contracts.

## Sourcify

Sourcify enables transparent and human-readable smart contract interactions through automated Solidity contract verification, contract metadata, and NatSpec comments.

## Slither

The Slither framework provides automated vulnerability and optimization detection, as well as assistive codebase summaries to further developer comprehension.

## Cucumber

Cucumber's user-friendly behavior-driven development, Playwright's precise browser automation, and the tailored dApp testing capabilities of Synpress. With Cucumber's Gherkin syntax, teams collaboratively define DApp behaviors. Playwright, customized for Chrome, adds finesse to browser automation. Synpress, in its Playwright version, effortlessly integrates with MetaMask (more software wallets to come) for thorough dApp testing.
