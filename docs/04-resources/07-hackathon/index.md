This guide details the necessary hardware and software requirements for developing on the Rootstock blockchain. 

It includes setup instructions for essential tools such as Java, Node.js, Hardhat, and RSKj, ensuring developers have a clear path to prepare their environment for Rootstock projects, whether for local development, testing, or deployment. 

For IRL hackathons and events, download the [Hackathon Cheatsheet PDF with QR Codes](/rootstock-cheatsheet.pdf).



## Prerequisites

To effectively use the Quickstart Kits and guides on this page, you should have:

1. **Basic Knowledge of Blockchain Technology**: Familiarity with blockchain concepts, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps) will help you understand the content more easily.
2. **Experience with Web3 Development Tools**: Knowledge of development tools and libraries such as Hardhat, **Web3.js**, and **Remix IDE** is recommended for working with smart contracts and interacting with decentralized networks.
3. **Programming Skills**: Proficiency in programming languages such as **JavaScript (React), Solidity**, and **Python (for Web3.py)** will be beneficial for building and deploying dApps.
4. **Understanding of ERC Standards**: Familiarity with common Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) standards like **ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155** will help you work with token contracts.
5. **Version Control with Git**: Basic experience with Git and GitHub for managing project files and collaborating on code.
6. **Knowledge of Account Abstraction and Automation Frameworks (Optional)**: For specific kits, understanding account abstraction concepts and automation frameworks like **Cucumber** can be advantageous.
