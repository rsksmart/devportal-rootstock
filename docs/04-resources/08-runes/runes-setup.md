### **Prerequisites**

Before getting started with the Runes Mock Bridge, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Familiarity with Remix IDE**  
   You should have a basic understanding of how to use Remix IDE, an online platform for writing, compiling, and deploying Solidity smart contracts.  
2. **Knowledge of Solidity**  
   A solid grasp of Solidity, the smart contract programming language, is essential. You'll be writing or interacting with Solidity contracts as part of this process.  
3. **MetaMask Wallet Installed and Connected to Rootstock Testnet**  
   Make sure you have [MetaMask](https://dev.rootstock.io/dev-tools/wallets/metamask/) installed in your browser, and know how to connect it to the Rootstock (RSK) network for managing your transactions.   
4. **Rootstock Account**  
   You'll need an account on the[RPC API Dashboard](https://dashboard.rpc.rootstock.io/login). This will allow you to create API keys for interacting with the Rootstock blockchain via RPC.  
5. **Local Copy of `bc-runes-js` Package**  
   Clone the [`bc-runes-js`](https://github.com/IOVgomezdn/bc-runes-js) package to your local environment. This package is necessary for generating a Taproot address and Wallet Import Format (WIF) key, which are required for the bridge.

Once these prerequisites are in place, you'll be ready to proceed with setting up and using the Runes Mock Bridge effectively.

### **Setting Up the `.env` File for the Runes Mock Bridge**

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PK='your-private-key'
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL='your rsk rpc url'
NEXT_PUBLIC_EXPLORER_URL=https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx
NEXT_PUBLIC_RSK_EXPLORER_URL= https://explorer.testnet.rootstock.io/tx
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS='your erc1155 contract address'
NEXT_PUBLIC_TAPROOT_ADDRESS='your taproot address'
NEXT_PUBLIC_WIF='your wif key'
```

To run the **Runes Mock Bridge** effectively, you'll need to set up the environment variables in a `.env` file. These variables are crucial for connecting your application to the blockchain network, accessing private keys, and managing other sensitive configurations. 

Here's a detailed guide on what each environment variable means, how to get them, and how to set up your `.env` file correctly.

#### **1\. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PK='your-private-key'`**

This is the private key for your application, which is essential for signing transactions or interacting with the blockchain via the Runes Mock Bridge

:::info[Info]
 Please avoid using a wallet that contains real funds for these exercises. Using an empty wallet ensures your funds remain secure and reduces the risk of unintentional loss.
:::

* You can obtain your private key from your wallet. Typically, you will export the private key from the wallet software you're using (like MetaMask or any other supported wallet).  
* Follow a detailed tutorial specific to your wallet on how to extract your private key, and then input it here.

#### **2\. `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL='your RSK RPC URL'`**

The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) URL is how your Runes Mock Bridge interacts with the Rootstock (RSK) blockchain.

* To get the RSK RPC URL, go to the[RPC API Dashboard](https://dashboard.rpc.rootstock.io/login) and log in. After logging in, you can create an API key that will give you access to the RPC URL.  
* Once the key is generated, you can use it to set up this variable, which allows your bridge to communicate with the blockchain.

#### **3\. `NEXT_PUBLIC_EXPLORER_URL=https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx`**

This is the URL for the **Bitcoin Testnet Explorer** provided by Blockstream, where you can track Bitcoin testnet transactions.

:::note[Note]
This value remains constant and doesn't need to be changed, as it will always point to the Bitcoin testnet explorer.
:::

#### **4\. `NEXT_PUBLIC_RSK_EXPLORER_URL=https://explorer.testnet.rootstock.io/tx`**

This is the URL for the **Rootstock Testnet Explorer**, where you can track transactions related to the Rootstock network.

* **Note:** 

:::note[Note]
Like the Blockstream explorer URL, this value is also constant and doesn't need to be changed. It is set to the correct Rootstock testnet explorer.
:::

#### **5\. `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS='your ERC-1155 contract address'`**

:::info[Important]
The RuneToken implementation used is not a standard ERC-1155 contract. It includes custom functions to freeze tokens transferred from Rootstock to Bitcoin. To ensure compatibility, please use the same (or an improved) version of the smart contract available in this repository: [RuneToken.sol](https://github.com/rsksmart/rsk-runes/blob/main/contracts/RuneToken.sol) and deploy it.
:::


This variable is used to specify the address of your deployed ERC-1155 contract, which plays a key role in the bridge's functionality.

* You need to deploy your ERC-1155 contract using Remix IDE or a similar tool. Once the deployment is complete, you will get the contract address.  
* Copy the contract address from Remix IDE after deployment and paste it into this variable.

#### **6\. `NEXT_PUBLIC_TAPROOT_ADDRESS='your taproot address'`**

Taproot addresses are used for Bitcoin transactions with improved privacy and flexibility. The Runes Mock Bridge requires a Taproot address for interacting with Bitcoin's taproot transactions.

* You can generate a Taproot address using a special package weâ€™ve created. Follow these steps:  
  1. Clone the repository from [bc-runes-js](https://github.com/IOVgomezdn/bc-runes-js.git).  
  2. Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.  
  3. Run `npm run generate-address` to generate the Taproot address.  
* Once generated, copy the Taproot address from the output and paste it into this variable.

```
> bc-runes-js@0.3.2 generate-address
> node src/utils/address.js --log=address

No WIF set, generating new random address
{
  taprootAddress: 'tb1pl9lcxu4f373dpzqzvq5amcm8het2chgwc45yhtlxkz5r66dq2zcqhfvrnx',
  WIF: 'cQwnr3fnmrkEPYNpCnsHqn7opcEwfezKbmadBD8b85XozXQCZyzP'
}

```
> you can generate multiple taproot address

#### **7\. `NEXT_PUBLIC_WIF='your WIF key'`**

The Wallet Import Format (WIF) key is the encoded version of your Bitcoin private key, which is necessary for signing Bitcoin transactions on the testnet.

* The same package used to generate the Taproot address will also generate the WIF key.  
  1. After running `npm run generate`, you will get both the Taproot address and the WIF key as part of the output.  
  2. Copy the WIF key and paste it into this variable.

#### 

   
:::note[Note]
**Security:** Ensure that the `.env` file is kept private and not exposed in public repositories or shared with unauthorized people. This file contains sensitive information such as your private keys, which could be exploited if leaked.

**Testing:** If you are using testnets (like Bitcoin or Rootstock testnets), make sure to configure your RPC URL, private keys, and contract addresses to match the appropriate testnet environment. This ensures that you're not interacting with the mainnet during development.
