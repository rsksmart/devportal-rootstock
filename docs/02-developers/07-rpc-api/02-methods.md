Find below a list of methods available on the RPC API. See [how to setup the RPC API](/developers/rpc-api/setup/).

## eth_accounts

- _Method:_ `eth_accounts`
  - Returns a list of addresses owned by the client. Since Rootstock RPC API does not store keys, this will always return empty.
- _Params:_ None

```shell
curl --location 'https://rpc.testnet.rootstock.io/<api-key>' \
--request POST \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "method":"eth_accounts",
    "params":[],
    "id":0
}'
```

- **Example Response:**

```js
{
"jsonrpc": "2.0",
"id": 0,
"result": []
}
```

## eth_blockNumber

- _Method:_ `eth_blockNumber`
  - Returns the number of the most recent block.
- _Params:_ None

```shell
curl --location 'https://rpc.testnet.rootstock.io/<api-key>' \
--request POST \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "method":"eth_blockNumber",
    "params":[],
    "id":0
}'
```

- Example Response:

```js
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 0,
    "result": "0x4bdcfb"
}
```

## eth_call

- Executes a new message call immediately without creating a transaction on the blockchain.
- _Params:_
  - `transaction`: object, the transaction call object which contains the following fields:
    - **from:** String, the address from which the transaction is sent
    - **to:** String, required, the address to which the transaction is addressed
    - **gas:** String, the integer of gas provided for the transaction execution
    - **gasPrice:** String, the integer of the `gasPrice` used for each paid gas, encoded as a hexadecimal
    - **value:** String, the integer of value sent with this transaction encoded as hexadecimal
    - **data:** string, the hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. For more information, see the Contract ABI description in the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html)
  - `blockNumber`: String, required. The number of the block (in hex) from which the number of transactions is required, OR one of the following block tags:
    - **latest:** the most recent block the client has available.
    - **earliest:** the lowest numbered block the client has available.
    - **pending:** A sample next block built by the client on top of latest and containing the set of transactions usually taken from a local mempool. Intuitively, you can think of these as blocks that have not been mined yet.

```

- **Example Response:**

```js
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",

}
```

Note that when `eth_estimateGas` is called, the node simulates the transaction execution without broadcasting it to the network.
The simulation runs through the entire transaction process as if it were being executed, including checking for sufficient balance, contract code execution, etc.
During the simulation, the method calculates the exact amount of gas that would be consumed by the transaction if it were to be executed on the blockchain. The estimated gas amount is returned, helping users set an appropriate gas limit for the actual transaction.

There is a difference in Rootstock compared to Ethereum, and it is that if one of the steps of the simulated transaction fails, the node will return the gas estimation needed for the transaction, while on Ethereum, the node will return an error instead of the gas estimation.

You can see this behavior on the following example, where we call `eth_estimateGas` for a transaction that would be executed from an address without enough balance.

Example:

```js
{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "method":"eth_estimateGas",
    "params":[
        {"from": "0xb60e8dd61c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07233155",
        "to": "0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567",
        "gas": "0x76c0",
        "gasPrice": "0x9184e72a000",
        "value": "0x9184e72a",
        "data": "0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8d46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f072445675058bb8eb970870f072445675"},
        "latest"
    ],
    "id":0
}
```

Response on Rootstock:

```js
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 0,
    "result": "0x5498"
}
```

Response on Ethereum:

```js
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 0,
    "error": {
        "code": -32000,
        "message": "insufficient funds for transfer"
    }
}
```

## eth_getBalance

- _Method:_ `eth_getBalance`

## eth_getCode

- _Method:_ Returns the compiled byte code of a smart contract, if any, at a given address.
- _Params:_
  - Address: String: required, address
  - Block: String, required, either the hexadecimal value of a blockNumber, OR a blockHash, OR one of the following block tags:
    - latest: the most recent block the client has available.
    - earliest: the lowest numbered block the client has available.
    - pending: A sample next block built by the client on top of latest and containing the set of transactions usually taken from a local mempool. Intuitively, you can think of these as blocks that have not been mined yet.
- **Example Request:**

```shell
curl --location 'https://rpc.testnet.rootstock.io/<api-key>' \
--request POST \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",

],

}'
```

}
```

## eth_getLogs

- _Method:_ `eth_getLogs`
  - Returns an array of all the logs matching the given filter object.
- _Params:_
  - `blockHash`: String, optional. Using blockHash is:
    - is equivalent to fromBlock = toBlock = the block number with hash blockHash
    - if blockHash is present in the filter criteria, then neither `fromBlock` nor `toBlock` are allowed.
    - `address`: String, optional. Contract address from which logs should originate.
  - `fromBlock`: String, optional.
    - either the hexadecimal value of a blockNumber, OR one of the following block tags:
      - **latest:** the most recent block the client has available.
      - **earliest:** the lowest numbered block the client has available.
      - **pending:** A sample next block built by the client on top of latest and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. Intuitively, you can think of these as blocks that have not been mined yet.
  - `toBlock`: String, optional.
    - either the hexadecimal value of a blockNumber, OR one of the following block tags:
      - **latest:** the most recent block the client has available.
      - **earliest:** the lowest numbered block the client has available.
      - **pending:** A sample next block built by the client on top of latest and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. Intuitively, you can think of these as blocks that have not been mined yet.
  - `topics`: Array of 32 bytes DATA topics, optional. The required topic to filter.
- _Returns:_
  - **log objects:** An array of log objects, or an empty array if nothing has changed since last poll. Log objects contain the following keys and their values:
    - **logIndex:** Hexadecimal of the log index position in the block. Null when it is a pending log.
    - **transactionIndex:** Hexadecimal of the transactions index position from which the log created. Null when it is a pending log.
    - **transactionHash:** 32 bytes. Hash of the transactions from which this log was created. Null when it is a pending log.
    - **blockHash:** 32 bytes. Hash of the block where this log was in. Null when it is a pending log.
    - **blockNumber:** Block number where this log was in. Null when it is a pending log.
    - **address:** 20 bytes. Address from which this log originated.
    - **data:** Contains one or more 32-bytes non-indexed arguments of the log.
    - **topics:** An array of 0 to 4 indexed log arguments, each 32 bytes. In solidity the first topic is the hash of the signature of the event (e.g. Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)), except when you declared the event with the anonymous specifier.
- Constraints:
  - You can make `eth_getLogs` requests on any block range with a cap of:
    - 10K logs in the response
    - OR a 2K block range with no cap on logs in the response
    - Note that it can be filtered either by blockHash OR (fromBlock and toBlock), but not both.
    - If `fromBlock`, `toBlock`, or `blockHash` are not specified, the query will return the logs corresponding to the latest block
- Example request by `blockHash`:
