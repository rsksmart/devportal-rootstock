:::note[Before you begin]

> If you're new to Web3 and Smart Contract Development, begin by exploring the [Rootstock network](/developers/blockchain-essentials/overview/). Then progress step by step to the [quick start Guide with Foundry](/developers/quickstart/foundry/) for a comprehensive understanding of the network and getting started with writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on Rootstock.

> Note: This guide is optimized for Node.js version 18 or earlier. If you're using a later version, consider using a version manager like [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) to switch to a compatible version.
