:::note[Before you begin]

> If you're new to Web3 and Smart Contract Development, begin by exploring the [Rootstock network](/developers/blockchain-essentials/overview/). Then progress step by step to the quick start Guide with Hardhat for a comprehensive understanding of the network and getting started with writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on Rootstock.

> For your convenience, we've established a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rsksmart/rootstock-quick-start-guide) dedicated to this guide. The [master branch](https://github.com/rsksmart/rootstock-quick-start-guide/tree/master) contains the initial project state, while the [feat/complete](https://github.com/rsksmart/rootstock-quick-start-guide/tree/feat/complete) branch features the complete project, equipped with all the necessary installations for your reference.

> Note: This guide is optimized for Node.js version 18 or earlier. If you're using a later version, consider using a version manager like [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) to switch to a compatible version.
